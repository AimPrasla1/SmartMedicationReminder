# SmartMedicationReminder
This C++ application helps users manage their medication schedules by providing reminders for when to take specific medications. The program allows users to:

Add new medications with the name, dosage, and time.

View a list of all scheduled medications.

Clear all saved medications from both memory and the data file.

The application runs a background thread to check the current time and notify the user when it's time to take their medication.
